SHOPPING CART ANGULAR

My first project which is written with Angular. I use JSON Server to create a fake API.

The application has already covered the following features:
- Display the products by getting from API 
- Add product to cart
- Add to wish list
- Routing functionality to Login page, Register page, Shop

The next upcomming features will be availables soon!
